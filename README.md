#Mission Building Block

Let's work together to come up with something great that saves lives

As we find ourselves against a faceless enemy threating everything, we hold dear our country and trajectory of our humanity; a sense of great responsibility motivates us, though distant from each other, to revive a modicum of hope in our world. COVID-19 has decided for us. Make no mistake about it, this is a mission laid on the lap of Omani innovators, manufacturers, young minds and patriots to solve for the unknown. Global healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, workers have been strung out of energy and the masses are imploring their governments as fear roams in the air. Now we come. For Oman. 

Aim: Mass produce innovative, cheap and agile ventilation automation systems to combat the COVID-19 outbreak in Oman.  
Due Date : April 4th (We encourage people to submit ideas even earlier, as we do need to act quickly)

Building Block: Inspired by HM Sultan Haitham Bin Tarq’s speech on the 23rd of Feb 2020: “Realizing the importance of … projects that are based on innovation, artificial intelligence and advanced technologies, and training and empowering young people to take advantage of the opportunities offered by this vital sector to be a basic building block in the national economy system, our government will work To keep track of progress in these aspects
